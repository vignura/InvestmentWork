2) How do I Invest ?
	* I invest directly in equities for capital gains and not for dividends.
	* I don't diversify rather I pick one company and hold on to it till it keeps growing.
	* If my pick does not perform as expected within the time frame that I defined, then I 
	  sell my position in that stock, minimizing my losses and move on to the next stock.
	* I pick a stock based on following fundamentals,
		1) Potential for Growth
		2) Quality of Management
		3) Storng Balancesheet
		4) Availability of credit on both production and consumption sides

	  thereby producing a "Sum that is greater than its parts" effect.

	  and achieve my investment goals simulataneously.

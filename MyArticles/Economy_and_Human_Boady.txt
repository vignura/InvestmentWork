The idea of comparing economy to human body came to me when I was reading an article on "Inflation cannot be a growth strategy" 
by Akanksha Ojha, in her blog Intolerant Akanksha.

This is the comment that I posted on her site after reading the article,

Hi akanksha, great article. The way  I understand inflation is that, increasing  money stock by reducing  repo rate thus 
increasing credit in the economy.  If the real goods and services that is produced by the country is growing at rate x% pa, 
then if money stock chasing that goods and services has also grown at same rate, then at a economy level, there shouldn't be 
any inflation, ie price rise,  but if the excess money stock created by lending due to lower rates,  chase a single commodity or 
sector or an asset like real estate,  then a bubble occurs, but I feel inflation of money stock is necessary for growth. If we
compare  the economy to a human body, then I would assume the money to be equivalent to blood, in order for the body to grow, it
requires energy, ie food and incase of an economy  I would assume the Investment capital to be that and skeletal structure of body
can be compared to the infrastructure of the country, various organs of the body can be compared to various organization present
in the economy,  and the muscles of the body can be compared to the workforce of the economy, with analogy of economy and body, 
in order to grow,  human body grows all of its parts propotionaly, so in order to grow the economy should also do the same, I
would think, that means a growing body would have growing bones, organs,  muscles and blood, so a growing economy, should  I
think,  grow its infrastructure(bones), organizations(organs),  workforce(muscles) and money stock (blood). I am new to the world
of economics and investing, self taught,  so I maybe wrong, but if going by analogy, inflation of money  stock is bad only when it
outpaces the growth of the parts of the economy, again thanks for the great article.

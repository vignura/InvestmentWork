THE WORLD BEFORE ECONOMICS:
===========================
1) But why are we jabbering about trade here? Because contrary to popular
belief, it is trade that makes the world go round, not money! Money is just
what is used to conduct a trade. See? You learn something new everyday!

2) What about the purpose and function of money? As someone put it
succinctly:
	Money’s a matter of functions four,
	A Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store.

3)Things may have proceeded indefinitely in this manner if it hadn’t been
for Europe. In the fourteenth century, a new and exciting energy had begun to
sweep across Europe as it shook off a dull and dreary period of its history,
now called the Dark Ages. The rumble began in Italy, but soon spread across
the continent. People who had blindly followed the rules laid down by priests
and kings and rarely thought about things for themselves began to question
everything. These new ‘rebels’ were curious about all kinds of stuff: How do
things work? Does the Bible really say what the priests say it says? Is there
anything I can build to make my work easier?

4) People began to experiment with art, science, politics, literature,
architecture, music and philosophy. The outpouring of creativity felt like a
revival of the intelligence and energy of mankind itself. The invention of the
printing press in 1440 by German innovator Johannes Gutenberg helped these
revolutionary ideas spread quickly, encouraging more people to think and
build and paint and write. No wonder the period is now called the
Renaissance (‘rebirth’ in French).

5) Kings and queens began thinking out of the box, too. Towards the
middle of the fifteenth century, Henry VII in England and King Ferdinand
and Queen Isabella in Spain emerged as the builders of the first ‘nation
states’—kingdoms where the rulers (and not a random bunch of chieftains)
held all the power, where all the people of the kingdom followed the same set
of rules and laws and paid the same taxes, and where everyone felt they were
part of one big (if not-always-happy) family

6) We are still in the fifteenth century, at a time when spices,especially 
pepper, were worth their weight in gold in Europe (Why? Because when you used
a lot of it, it masked the smell and taste of rotting meat. This was before 
refrigerators were invented, remember! Ugh!).
